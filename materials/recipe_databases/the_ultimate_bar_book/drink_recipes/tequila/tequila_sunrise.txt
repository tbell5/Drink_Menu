1 1/2 ounces silver tequila
6 ounces fresh orange juice
1/2 ounce grenadine (or Chambord)
2 to 3 ounces chilled club soda (optional)

STIRRED OVER ICE: Pour the tequila and orange juice into an ice-filled highball
glass, and stir. Float the grenadine on top, and let it slowly descend through
the drink. Top with club soda, if desired.

SHAKEN: Pour the grenadine in the bottom of a chilled cocktail glass. Shake the
tequila and orange juice vigorously with ice, and strain into the glass.
