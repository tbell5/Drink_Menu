2 lime wedges
salt
1 1/2 ounces pepper-infused tequila
3/4 ounces triple sec or other orange liqueur
1 1/2 ounces sweet-and-sour
1/2 cup washed, stemmed, halved orange cherry tomatoes
1 clove garlic, finely minced
1 chopped green onion 
2 to 3 dashes Worcestershire sauce
2 orange cherry tomatoes

Rub the rim of a chilled margarita glass with a lime wedge and rim with salt.
Blend all ingredients except the garnish with 3 to 4 ice cubes until pureed and
smooth. Pour the blended mixture into the prepared glass. Garnish with the 
remaining lime wedge, skewered between the two tomatoes.
