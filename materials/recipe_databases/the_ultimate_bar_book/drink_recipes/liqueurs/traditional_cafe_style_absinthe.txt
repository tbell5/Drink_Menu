1½ ounces Pernod (or other absinthe substitute)
1 sugar cube
5 ounces cold filtered water
1 perforated spoon

Pour the Pernod into a pousse-café or sour glass. Place the perforated spoon 
across the top of the glass, resting it on the rim. Position a sugar cube on 
the spoon, and slowly pour the water over the sugar cube, until the sugar is 
dissolved and the mixture in the glass turns cloudy.
