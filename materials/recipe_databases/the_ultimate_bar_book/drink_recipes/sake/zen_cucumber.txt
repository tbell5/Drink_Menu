4 ounces good-quality sake
1 ounce fresh lemon juice
1 ounce simple syrup
4 to 5 thin slices of cucumber (preferably English cucumber)

Shake all ingredients but the garnish vigorously with ice. Strain into a 
chilled cocktail glass. Garnish by floating a few cucumber slices on top of the 
drink.

VARIATION: Pour the entire contents of the shaker into a highball glass, ice 
and all. Top with chilled club soda.
