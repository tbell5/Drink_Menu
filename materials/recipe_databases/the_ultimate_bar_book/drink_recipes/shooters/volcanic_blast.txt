¼ ounce Kahlúa
¼ ounce Cointreau
¼ ounce raspberry syrup
¼ ounce papaya juice
¼ ounce Captain Morgan Spiced Rum
½ teaspoon 151-proof rum

Pour the Kahlúa into a heat-proof 2-ounce shot glass or pousse-café glass. 
Continue to layer the ingredients by angling a spoon down into the glass and 
slowly pouring each liquid over the back of the spoon, in order and one at a 
time. Carefully ignite the 151 rum and let it burn for a few seconds. Blow out 
the flame, and let the glass cool a bit before sipping.
