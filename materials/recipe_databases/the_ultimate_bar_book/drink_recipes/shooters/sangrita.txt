6 ounces tomato juice
6 ounces fresh orange juice
2 ounces fresh lime juice
¼ ounce grenadine
½ ounce green Tabasco (or other hot sauce), or to taste
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1½ ounces tequila per serving

Combine all ingredients except the tequila in a glass jar with a lid. Cover and 
chill for at least 2 hours. Pour 1½ ounces of the mixture into a chilled shot 
glass, and serve with a 1½-ounce shot of tequila. Toss back the tequila, and 
chase it with the Sangrita.
