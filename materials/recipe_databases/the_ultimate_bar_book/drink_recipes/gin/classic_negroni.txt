1 ounce gin
1 ounce Campari
1 ounce sweet vermouth
2 to 3 ounces chilled club soda (optional)
Orange slice

Shake the gin, Campari, and vermouth vigorously with ice. Strain into an ice-
filled highball glass. Top with club soda, if desired. Garnish with the orange 
slice.

VARIATIONS:
For a Negroni Cocktail, this version is shaken and served up. Shake the gin, 
Campari, and vermouth vigorously with ice. Strain into a chilled cocktail 
glass. Omit the club soda. Garnish with an orange twist instead of the orange 
slice.
 
For a Punt e Mes Negroni, substitute ½ ounce Punt e Mes for the Campari.

For a Cardinal, substitute 1 ounce dry vermouth for the sweet vermouth. Club 
soda is optional.

For a Dirty Dick's Downfall (after Nixon), a lighter, drier version, use 2 
ounces gin, ½ ounce dry vermouth, and ½ ounce Campari. Garnish with a lemon 
twist.
