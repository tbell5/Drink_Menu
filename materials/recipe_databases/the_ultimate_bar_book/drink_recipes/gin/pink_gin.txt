4 to 5 dashes Angostura or Peychaud's bitters
2Â½ ounces chilled gin
Lemon twist

Pour the bitters into a chilled sherry or cocktail glass, and swirl to coat the 
glass. Discard the excess. Pour in the gin. Garnish with the lemon twist.

VARIATION: For a Gin and Pink, add 5 ounces tonic water and serve over ice in a 
highball glass, with a lemon twist.
