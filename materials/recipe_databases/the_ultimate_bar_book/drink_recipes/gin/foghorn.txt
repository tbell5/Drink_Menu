2 ounces gin
Â½ ounce fresh lime juice
3 to 5 ounces chilled ginger ale or ginger beer
Lime wedge

Pour the gin and lime juice into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass. Top with 
ginger ale and stir gently. Squeeze the lime wedge over the drink, and drop it 
in.

VARIATIONS: 
For a Dragonfly (also known as Prohibition Champagne), squeeze the lime wedge 
only, omitting the lime juice.

For a Leap Frog (basically a Gin Buck), substitute 2 ounces lemon juice for the 
lime juice.
