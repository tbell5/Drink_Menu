3 ounces premium-quality gin
Lemon twist or green cocktail olive (optionally infused with dry vermouth)

Stir or shake the gin in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into a chilled 
cocktail glass. Run the lemon peel around the rim, twist it over the drink, and 
drop it in, or simply drop in the olive.
