2 ounces spiced rum (such as Captain Morgan) 
1/2 ounce chocolate liqueur (such as Godiva) 
Orange twist 
Maraschino cherry 

Stir the liquid ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into a chilled 
cocktail glass. Run the orange peel around the rim, twist it over the drink, 
and drop it in, along with the cherry.
