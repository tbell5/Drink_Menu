1 lime, quartered 
1 tablespoon honey 
1 ounce Damiana liqueur 
1 1/2 ounces Rhum Barbancourt 
3 ounces fresh tangerine juice 

Squeeze the lime wedges over a chilled double old-fashioned glass, and then 
drop them in. Add the honey and Damiana, and muddle with the limes. Fill the 
glass with ice, and pour in the rum and tangerine juice. Stir briefly.
