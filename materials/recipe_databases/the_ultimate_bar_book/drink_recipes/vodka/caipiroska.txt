1 lime, cut into 8 wedges
1 tablespoon sugar
2 ounces vodka

Muddle the lime wedges with the sugar in the bottom of an old- fashioned glass. 
Fill the glass with crushed ice, add the vodka, and stir well.

VARIATION: For an Orange Caipiroska, substitute orange (or mandarin) vodka for 
the regular vodka, and a few orange and lemon wedges for the lime.
