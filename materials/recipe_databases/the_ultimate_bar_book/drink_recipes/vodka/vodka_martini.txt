2 ounces vodka
½ ounce dry vermouth
Lemon twist (or green cocktail olive)

Stir the liquid ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into a chilled 
cocktail glass. Run the lemon peel around the rim, twist it over the drink, and 
drop it in (or garnish with an olive).

VARIATIONS: 
For a Kangaroo (less dry than the classic Vodka Martini), use 1½ ounces vodka 
and ¾ ounce dry vermouth.

For a Dirty Vodka Martini, add a dash of juice from a jar of green olives.

For a "bone-dry" Vodka Martini, simply sip chilled vodka neat.
