1½ ounces vodka (or vanilla-flavored vodka)
½ ounce espresso or strong coffee
½ ounce Kahlúa
½ ounce crème de cacao
3 espresso beans

Stir the liquid ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into a chilled 
cocktail glass. Garnish with the espresso beans.

VARIATION: For a Javanese Martini (a dark, and aromatic version for coffee-
lovers), rim the glass with turbinado sugar, substitute 1 ounce Tia Maria for 
the Kahlúa, leave out the crème de cacao, and garnish with a lemon twist.
