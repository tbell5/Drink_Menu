2 ounces vodka
4 to 5 ounces cranberry juice
Â½ ounce fresh lime juice
Lime wedge

Shake the liquid ingredients vigorously with ice. Strain into an ice-filled 
highball glass. Squeeze the lime wedge over the drink, and drop it in.

VARIATIONS: 
Add a splash of club soda.

For a classic Madras, add 2 ounces fresh orange juice and top with the 
cranberry juice, slowly blending; do not stir.
