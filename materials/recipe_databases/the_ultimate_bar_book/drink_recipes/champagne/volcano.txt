¾ ounce raspberry liqueur
¾ ounce blue curaçao
3 to 5 ounces chilled champagne
Orange twist

Shake the raspberry liqueur and curaçao vigorously with ice. Strain into a 
chilled champagne flute, and slowly top with champagne. Run the orange peel 
around the rim, twist it over the drink, and drop it in.
