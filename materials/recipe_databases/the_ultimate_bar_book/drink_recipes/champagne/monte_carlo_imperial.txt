¾ ounce gin
¼ ounce white crème de menthe
½ ounce fresh lemon juice
3 to 5 ounces chilled champagne
Shake all ingredients but the champagne vigorously with ice. Strain into a chilled champagne flute, and slowly top with champagne.

VARIATION: For a Monte Carlo Highball, increase the gin to 1¾ ounces, increase 
the lemon juice to 1 ounce, and serve in a highball glass.
