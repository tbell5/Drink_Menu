1 sugar cube
2 to 3 dashes Angostura bitters
3 to 5 ounces chilled dry champagne
Lemon twist

In the bottom of a chilled champagne flute, soak the sugar cube with the 
bitters. Slowly top with champagne. Run the lemon peel around the rim, twist it 
over the drink, and drop it in.

VARIATIONS: 
For a London Special, substitute a long orange peel spiral for the lemon peel; 
place half in the cocktail and leave half hanging over the edge of the glass.

For an Irish Champagne Cocktail, add 1 ounce Irish whiskey.
