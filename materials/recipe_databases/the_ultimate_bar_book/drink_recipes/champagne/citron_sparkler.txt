2 tablespoons softened lemon sorbet
Â½ ounce Galliano
3 to 5 ounces chilled prosecco (or champagne)
2 fresh cranberries

Combine the lemon sorbet and Galliano in the bottom of a chilled champagne 
flute. Slowly pour in the champagne. Skewer or drop the cranberries into the 
drink.

VARIATION: For a fruity alternative, substitute 1 ounce Chambord for the 
Galliano, and serve with a mint sprig.
