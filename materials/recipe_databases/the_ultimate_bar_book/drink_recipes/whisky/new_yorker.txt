1½ ounces bourbon (or rye) 
¾ ounce fresh lime juice 
1 teaspoon sugar 
Dash of grenadine 
Orange twist 
Lemon twist 

Pour the bourbon and lime juice into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass. Add the 
sugar and grenadine and stir well. Twist the lemon and orange peels over the 
drink, and drop them in. 

VARIATION: For a New York Cocktail, substitute blended whiskey for the bourbon. 
Some recipes also substitute lemon juice for the lime juice.
