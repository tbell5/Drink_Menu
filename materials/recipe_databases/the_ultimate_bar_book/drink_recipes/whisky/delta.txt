1½ ounces blended whiskey 
½ ounce Southern Comfort 
½ ounce fresh lime juice 
1 teaspoon sugar 
Orange slice 
Peach slice 

Shake the liquid ingredients and sugar vigorously with ice. Strain into an ice-
filled old-fashioned glass. Garnish with the orange and peach slices. 

VARIATION: For a Little Colonel, substitute bourbon for the blended whiskey, 
increase the Southern Comfort to 1 ounce, and omit the sugar.
