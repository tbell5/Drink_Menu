1 sugar cube (or 2 teaspoons sugar)
3 dashes Angostura bitters 
1 strip lemon zest 
1 orange slice 
1 maraschino cherry 
2½ ounces bourbon (or blended whiskey) 
2 to 3 ounces chilled club soda (optional) 
Orange slice 
Maraschino cherry 

In the bottom of a chilled old-fashioned glass, saturate the sugar cube with 
the bitters. Add the lemon zest, orange slice, and cherry. Muddle together the 
sugar, bitters, and fruit. Fill the glass with ice, add the bourbon, and stir 
well. Top with club soda, if desired. Garnish with the orange slice and cherry. 

VARIATIONS: 
For an Eccentric Old-Fashioned, place 1 complete lemon peel spiral in the 
glass. Shake 2 ounces blended whiskey, a dash of curaçao, and ½ teaspoon sugar, 
and strain into the glass. 

For a Canadian Old-Fashioned, substitute blended Canadian whisky for the bourbon, and add ¼ ounce Cointreau, and a dash of fresh lemon juice. 

For a Scotch Old-Fashioned, substitute blended scotch for the bourbon. 

For a Claremont (a fruitier version), muddle 2 maraschino cherries and 2 orange
slices, and add ¾ ounce orange curaçao.
