2 ounces Canadian blended whisky 
½ ounce Cointreau 
½ ounce Dubonnet Rouge 
Lemon twist 

Stir the liquid ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into a chilled 
cocktail glass. Run the lemon peel around the rim, twist it over the drink, and 
drop it in. 

VARIATIONS: 
For a Trois Rivières (French for “three rivers“), reduce the Cointreau to ¼ 
ounce, and use an orange twist instead of lemon. 

For a Temptation Cocktail, add a dash of Pernod.
