1 teaspoon Pernod (or Herbsaint)
2 ounces Cognac (or bourbon or rye) 
3 to 4 dashes Peychaudâ€™s bitters 
Lemon twist 

Coat the inside of a chilled old-fashioned glass with the Pernod, discarding 
the excess. Shake the Cognac and bitters vigorously with ice. Strain into the 
prepared glass. Twist the lemon peel over the drink, and drop it in.
