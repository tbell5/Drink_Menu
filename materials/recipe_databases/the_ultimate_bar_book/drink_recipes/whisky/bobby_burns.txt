1½ ounces scotch 
1½ ounces sweet vermouth 
¼ ounce Bénédictine 
Lemon twist 

Shake the liquid ingredients vigorously with ice. Strain into a chilled 
cocktail glass. Twist the lemon peel over the drink, and drop it in. 

VARIATION: For a Brainstorm Cocktail, substitute Irish whiskey for the scotch, 
and use ¼ ounce dry vermouth in place of the sweet vermouth.
