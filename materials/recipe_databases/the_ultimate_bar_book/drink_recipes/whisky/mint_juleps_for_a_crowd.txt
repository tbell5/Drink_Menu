1 bottle (750 ml) Kentucky bourbon 
2 cups fresh mint leaves (or 10 to 12 mint sprigs) 
1 to 3 ounces simple syrup 
12 to 18 fresh mint sprigs 
6 lemon twists (optional) 

Combine the bourbon and mint leaves in a large glass jar with a lid. Cover and 
refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. Strain the bourbon into a large glass 
pitcher, discarding the mint. Add simple syrup to taste, and stir. For each 
serving, pour 4 ounces of the infused bourbon into a julep cup or collins glass 
filled with crushed ice. Add a few mint sprigs and a twist of lemon peel, if 
desired, to each drink, and serve with straws.
