2 ounces bourbon 
½ ounce apricot brandy 
½ ounce fresh lemon juice 
5 to 6 ounces chilled ginger ale 
Lemon wheel 

Shake all liquid ingredients except the ginger ale vigorously with ice. Strain 
into an ice-filled collins glass. Top with ginger ale. Garnish with the lemon 
wheel, and add a swizzle stick. 

VARIATION: For a Scotch Swizzle, substitute scotch for the bourbon, triple sec 
for the apricot brandy, and lime juice for the lemon juice.
