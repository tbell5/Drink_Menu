2 ounces blended Canadian whisky or bourbon 
¼ ounce dry vermouth 
¼ ounce Dubonnet Rouge 
½ ounce fresh orange juice 

Shake the ingredients vigorously with ice. Strain into a chilled cocktail 
glass. 

VARIATION: For a Rue de Rivoli, use equal parts (1 ounce) of each liquor. Serve 
over ice in an old-fashioned glass.
