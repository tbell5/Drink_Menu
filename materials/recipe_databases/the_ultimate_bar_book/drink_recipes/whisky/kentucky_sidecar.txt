Lemon or tangerine wedge 
Sugar 
1½ ounces small-batch bourbon 
¾ ounce Cointreau 
1 ounce fresh tangerine juice 
½ ounce fresh lemon juice 
Mint sprig 

Rub the rim of a chilled cocktail glass with the lemon or tangerine wedge and 
rim with sugar. Shake the liquid ingredients vigorously with ice. Strain into 
the prepared glass. Garnish with the mint sprig. 

VARIATIONS: 
For a superminty version, add 4 or 5 fresh mint leaves to the cocktail shaker, 
and shake with the liquid ingredients.

For a Kentucky Fizz, serve over ice in an old-fashioned glass with a splash of 
club soda. 

For a Kentucky Orange Blossom, increase the tangerine juice to 1½ ounces, and 
omit the lemon juice. Add a dash of orange flower water, and serve over ice in 
an old-fashioned glass.
