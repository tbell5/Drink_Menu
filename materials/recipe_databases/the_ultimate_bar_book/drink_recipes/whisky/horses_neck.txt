Lemon peel spiral 
2½ ounces blended whiskey 
3 to 5 ounces chilled ginger ale 

Place the lemon peel spiral in a chilled highball glass. Fill with ice, pour in 
the whiskey, and top with ginger ale. Stir briefly. 

VARIATION:

For a Klondike Cooler, substitute rye for the blended whiskey, add 1 teaspoon 
sugar, and use an orange peel spiral instead of lemon.
