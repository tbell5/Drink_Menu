12 to 14 fresh mint leaves 
1 teaspoon simple syrup 
4 ounces Kentucky bourbon 
2 to 3 mint sprigs 
Lemon twist (optional) 

Muddle the mint leaves and simple syrup in the bottom of a chilled julep cup or 
old-fashioned glass. Fill the glass with crushed ice, add the bourbon, and stir 
until the glass is frosty. Garnish with the mint sprigs, extending them above 
the rim, and a twist of lemon peel, if desired.
