2½ ounces blended scotch 
½ ounce sweet vermouth 
Dash of Angostura bitters 
Maraschino cherry

Stir the liquid ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into a chilled 
cocktail glass or into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass. Garnish with the 
cherry. 

VARIATIONS: 
For a Dry Rob Roy, substitute dry vermouth for the sweet vermouth, and garnish 
with a lemon twist. 

For a Perfect Rob Roy, use ¼ ounce dry vermouth and ¼ ounce sweet vermouth, and 
garnish with a lemon twist. 

For an Affinity (a classic variation on the Perfect Rob Roy), use equal parts 
(1 ounce each) scotch, dry vermouth, and sweet vermouth. 

For another version of an Affinity, use equal parts (1 ounce each) scotch, dry 
sherry, and ruby port. Garnish with a cherry. 

For a Highland Fling (closer to a Manhattan), increase the sweet vermouth to ¾ 
ounce, and use orange bitters in place of the Angostura. 

For a Thistle cocktail, use equal parts (1½ ounces each) scotch and sweet 
vermouth. 

For a Flying Scotsman (a sweeter variation), add ¼ ounce simple syrup.
