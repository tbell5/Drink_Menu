1Â½ ounces whiskey 
8 ounces chilled lager or pale ale 

Pour the whiskey into a shot glass. Pour the beer into a frosted beer mug. 
Drink down the shot of whiskey, and immediately drink the beer as a chaser. Or 
drop the whiskey-filled shot glass into a mug of beer and drink it down. 

VARIATION: Beer has always played a key role as the classic chaser for a shot of spirits. Feel free to choose a tequila, spicy flavored vodka, or schnapps in place of the whiskey.
