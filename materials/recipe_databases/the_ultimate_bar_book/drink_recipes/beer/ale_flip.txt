1 ounce fresh lemon juice 
12 ounces chilled ale 
Pinch of ground ginger 
1 tablespoon sugar 
1 egg yolk 
1 ounce brandy 

In a saucepan, heat the lemon juice with 2 ounces of the ale, ginger, and sugar 
over moderate heat until the sugar dissolves. Beat the egg yolk into the brandy 
in a small bowl. Add the heated mixture to the egg yolk mixture, and beat until 
smooth. Pour into a beer mug, and slowly add the rest of the ale, stirring 
well.
