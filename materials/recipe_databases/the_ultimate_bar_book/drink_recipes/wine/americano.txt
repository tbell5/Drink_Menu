1½ ounces Campari
1½ ounces sweet vermouth
2 to 3 ounces chilled club soda
Lemon twist
Orange twist

Stir the Campari and vermouth in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into an ice-
filled old-fashioned glass. Top with club soda and stir gently. Twist the lemon 
and orange peels over the drink, and drop them in.

VARIATION: For a lighter version, strain into an ice-filled highball glass and 
add more club soda.
