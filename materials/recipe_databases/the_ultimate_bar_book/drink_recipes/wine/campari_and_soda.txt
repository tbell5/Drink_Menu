2 ounces Campari
2 to 3 ounces chilled club soda
Orange or lemon twist

Pour the Campari into an ice-filled old-fashioned glass. Top with club soda and 
stir gently. Run the orange or lemon peel around the rim, twist it over the 
drink, and drop it in.

VARIATION: For a lighter drink, pour into a chilled highball glass with ice, 
and add more club soda.
