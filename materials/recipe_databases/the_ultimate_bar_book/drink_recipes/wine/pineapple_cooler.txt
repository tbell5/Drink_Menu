2 ounces chilled dry white wine (such as chardonnay, pinot gris, or sauvignon blanc)
2 ounces pineapple juice
¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
½ teaspoon superfine sugar
2 to 3 ounces chilled club soda
Lemon twist

Shake the wine, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and sugar vigorously with ice. 
Strain into an ice-filled highball glass. Top with club soda and stir gently. 
Run the lemon peel around the rim, twist it over the drink, and drop it in.
