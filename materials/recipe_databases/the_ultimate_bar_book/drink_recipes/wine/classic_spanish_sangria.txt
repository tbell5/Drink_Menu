1 orange, sliced
1 lime, sliced
½ lemon, sliced
1½ ounces brandy
1½ ounces Cointreau
2 tablespoons sugar
One 750-ml bottle dry red wine, chilled
One 12-ounce bottle club soda, chilled
About 3 cups ice cubes

In a large (2-quart) glass pitcher, combine the orange, lime, and lemon slices. 
Add the brandy, Cointreau, and sugar, and stir to combine. Gently stir in the 
wine. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or as long as overnight to chill.

When ready to serve, add the club soda, stirring gently. Pour into ice-filled 
wine goblets, letting some fruit fall into each drink.

VARIATIONS: 
For Sangria Blanca, a white wine version, use either a chilled sauvignon blanc, 
pinot grigio, or chardonnay in place of the red wine, and add red and green 
grapes, peach or apple slices, or strawberries and mint sprigs.

For Sparkling Sangria, use chilled dry champagne instead of the red wine, and 
add grapefruit or pineapple, and mango or raspberries. Add the champagne right 
before serving.

For a Rosado Sangria, use rosé wine instead of the red wine, and add 
raspberries and blackberries, or limes and peaches.
