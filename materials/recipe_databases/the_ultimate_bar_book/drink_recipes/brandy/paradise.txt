1 ounce apricot brandy
¾ ounce gin
¾ ounce fresh orange juice

Shake the ingredients vigorously with ice. Strain into a chilled cocktail 
glass.

VARIATIONS: 
Another version increases the gin to 1 ounce and adds ½ ounce fresh lime juice.

For a Royal Smile Cocktail, substitute ½ ounce lemon juice for the orange 
juice, and add a dash of grenadine.
