1 ounce brandy (or Cognac)
1 ounce brown crème de cacao
1 ounce heavy cream
Fresh grated or ground nutmeg

Shake the liquid ingredients vigorously with ice. Strain into a chilled 
cocktail glass. Sprinkle a dusting of nutmeg on top.

VARIATIONS: 
For a blended ice cream version, increase the brandy and crème de cacao to 2 
ounces each, and substitute ½ cup vanilla ice cream for the cream. Combine in a 
blender until smooth. Sprinkle with nutmeg.

For a Panama Cocktail, substitute white crème de cacao for the brown crème de 
cacao.
