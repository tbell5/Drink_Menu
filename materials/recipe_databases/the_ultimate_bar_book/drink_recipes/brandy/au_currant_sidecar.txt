Lemon wedge
Sugar
1½ ounces Metaxa
1 ounce fresh lemon juice
1 ounce fresh orange juice
½ ounce crème de cassis
1 ounce Grand Marnier
1 teaspoon superfine sugar
Lemon twist

Rub the rim of a chilled cocktail glass with the lemon wedge and rim with 
sugar. Shake the liquid ingredients and superfine sugar vigorously with ice. 
Strain into the prepared glass. Twist the lemon peel over the top of the drink, 
and drop it in.

VARIATION: The black raspberry flavor of Chambord liqueur is a fine option in 
place of the crème de cassis.
