1½ ounces brandy
1 ounce Dubonnet
¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
Lemon twist and orange twist

Pour the liquid ingredients into an ice-filled highball glass. Twist the lemon 
and orange peel over the drink, and drop them in.

VARIATION: For a Phoebe Snow, substitute Pernod (or anisette) for the lemon 
juice.
